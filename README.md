This project is a responsive **Admin Dashboard UI** layout built using **CSS Grid**. It's one of the practice projects I created while learning and exploring the power of CSS Grid Layout in web design.

## 📚 What This Project Is About

While learning **CSS Grid**, I decided to build a dashboard layout that includes:

- A sidebar with icons and navigation links
- A top header with search and action buttons
- A main content area showcasing "Your Projects"
- An aside section with announcements and trending users
- Responsive layout using **Media Queries** for small and medium screens

The goal was to practice **real-world layout structure**, positioning, and responsiveness using only **HTML and CSS**, especially **CSS Grid**.
